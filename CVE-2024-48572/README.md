# CVE-2024-48572

## Description:

A user enumeration vulnerability in AquilaCMS 1.409.20 and prior allows unauthenticated attackers to obtain email addresses via the **Add a user** feature. The vulnerability occurs due to insufficiently validated user input being processed as a regular expression, which is then matched against email addresses to find duplicate entries.

## Impact:

Successful exploitation makes it possible for attackers to obtain all registered email addresses by identifying valid characters for each position in the email addresses.
