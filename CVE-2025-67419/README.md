## Description:

A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in EverShop 2.1.0 and prior allows unauthenticated attackers to exhaust the application server's resources via the **GET /images** API. The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of restrictions on the height of the use-element shadow tree or the dimensions of pattern tiles during the processing of SVG files.

## Impact:

Successful exploitation makes it possible for attackers to trigger unbounded resource consumption and system-wide denial of service.
