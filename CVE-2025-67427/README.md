# CVE-2025-67427

## Description:

A Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in EverShop 2.1.0 and prior allows unauthenticated attackers to force the server to initiate an HTTP request via the **GET /images** API. The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient validation of the `src` query parameter, which permits arbitrary HTTP or HTTPS URIs.

## Impact:

Successful exploitation makes it possible for attackers to trigger HTTP requests against internal and external networks.
