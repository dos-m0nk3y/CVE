# CVE-2024-50671

## Description:

An improper access control vulnerability in Adapt Authoring Tool 0.11.3 and prior allows attackers with **Authenticated User** roles to obtain email addresses via the **Get users** feature. The vulnerability occurs due to a flaw in permission verification logic, where the wildcard character in permitted URLs grants unintended access to endpoints restricted to users with **Super Admin** roles.

## Impact:

Successful exploitation makes it possible for attackers to obtain all registered email addresses.
